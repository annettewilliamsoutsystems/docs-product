# Gallery

You can use the Gallery UI Pattern to display groups of content as scannable collections. This UI pattern allows users to sequentially browse images, with the notion of a beginning and an end. The Gallery UI pattern can be helpful when you have a large number of cards you need to group into one or more scannable collections.
