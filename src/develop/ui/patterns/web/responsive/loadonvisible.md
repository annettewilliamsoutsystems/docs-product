# Load on Visible 

You can use the Load on Visible UI pattern to enhance the speed of your application as well as improve  user experience. Using this UI pattern,  information is loaded onto the page only when it is visible. For example, instead of loading all text and images onto a page at once, they only appear when the user scrolls down the page and the information/image becomes visible.

**How to Use the Load on Display UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, select the **Interface** tab.
1. On the left side of the screen, in the **Search** field, enter **Load on Visible**. 
1. From the Toolbox, drag the Load on Visible block onto your application's screen.
1. Add the relevant content to the placeholders, for example, images.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
