# Responsive Table

You can use the Responsive Table UI pattern to display information in a logical and organized way. The Responsive Table UI pattern allows interaction, such as sorting, so that users can customize how they view information.

**How to Use the Responsive Table UI Pattern**  

**Prerequisite**: A pre-populated table of records.

1. In Service Studio, select the **Interface** tab.
2. On the left side of the screen, in the **Search** field, enter **Responsive Table**. 

    The Responsive Table block is displayed.

    ![](<images/responsivetable-image-1.png?width=500>)

4. Drag your pre-populated table of records into the Content placeholder.
