**Prerequisites:** You have created an Input widget called CharacterCount.

    The Character Count widget is displayed.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Character Count widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/charactercount-image-8.png>)

1. On the **Properties** tab, set the **InputWidgetId** property to the Input widget name (CharacterCount) and use the **Limit** property to set the maximum number of characters allowed, for example, 50.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.

## Properties

| **Property** |  **Description** |
|---|---|
| InputWidgetId (Text): Mandatory | Input element name that triggers the count. A valid expression must be set for this property. |
| Limit (Integer): Mandatory  | Character count limit. This value should be the same as the Max Length of the Input widget. |
| IsDescending (Boolean): Optional  | If set to False, the count goes from 0 to the limit set for the Limit property. If set to True, the count goes from the Limit property to 0. This is the default setting.|
